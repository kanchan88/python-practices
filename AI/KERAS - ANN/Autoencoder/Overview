Autoencoder is generally used in Unsupervised Learning used in things like Noise Removal, Dimensionality Reduction. Sometime we get access to historical data as well so we call them Semi-Supervised.

What is AutoEncoder and How it works?

1.Simple Neural Network
2.Reproduce its input at output level
3.One difference between Multi Perceptron is that the number of input and output is same

It has 2 parts: Encoding and Decoding.
 
In encoding, reduce the some desired of neurons and find what values are important. Which inputs are important to replicate the model. 

In decoding, we go back and get same number of input.

We then use Encoder only for data representation.
