1. Every thing in Python that can be looped over uses iterator behind the hood. Like list, tuple

2. Iterator has __next__ and __iter__ methods

3. Lazy evaluation : They help to save resource as we can loop over one at a time and we should not save in memory like For loop (which allocated reosurces memory to all result )

4.  Simplifying Iterator : Generator
